# Football Poster Lorient
The beginning of 2022/2023 season in french Ligue 1 brought an astound, underdog team Lorient found themselves on the runner-up position with performances way over previous expectations. That inspired me and my colleagues to create a poster scrutinizing this peculiarity as a project for the Data Visualization course conducted at WUT.
